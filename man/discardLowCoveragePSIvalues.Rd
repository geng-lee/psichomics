\usage{
discardLowCoveragePSIvalues(
  psi,
  minReads = 10,
  vasttoolsScoresToDiscard = c("VLOW", "N")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{psi}{Data frame or matrix: alternative splicing quantification}

\item{minReads}{Currently this argument does nothing}

\item{vasttoolsCoverage}{Character: if you are using inclusion levels from
VAST-TOOLS, filter the data based on quality scores for read coverage, e.g.
use \code{vasttoolsCoverage = c("SOK", "OK", "LOW")} to only keep events with
good read coverage (by default, events are not filtered based on quality
scores); read \url{https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools} for more
information on VAST-TOOLS quality scores}
}
\value{
Alternative splicing quantification data with missing values for any
values with insufficient coverage
}
